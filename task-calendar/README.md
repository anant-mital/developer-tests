## General programming task

Look at `FileBasedCalendarProvider.getCalendar()` and start from there. Once you are done with reading the file, head on to `SimpleCalendar` and finish the implementation so that all the tests pass.

You have approximately 45 minutes, although this is not a hard limit. Once all the tests pass, congratulations!
