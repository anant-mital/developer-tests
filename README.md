# Overview

This repository contains a few tasks to implement during a developer interview task.

This is the `master` branch and it contains no code. Please switch to some other branch:
* `task-data` for a general programming task
* `task-calculator` for another general programming task
* `task-optimise` for a code optimisation task
* `task-css` for a set of simple CSS tasks

After checking out your branch, open `README.md` and follow the instructions.

# More details

You **are allowed** to search the web for any API or code examples related to your tasks. You are **not allowed** to search for solutions ;) 

Whenever you are unclear about what exactly is expected, **ask immediately**.

#### Small print

Using branches for storing separate projects is not how git should be used. I know.
