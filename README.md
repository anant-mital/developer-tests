## CSS tasks

Open `src/html/basic-test.html`. It describes three tasks to be accomplished by adding proper CSS rules to `src/html/styles.css`.

There is no *reference screenshot* associated with these tasks - anything that matches the specification will work.

You have approximately 45 minutes, although this is not a hard limit.
