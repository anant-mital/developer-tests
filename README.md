# Overview

This repository contains a few tasks to implement during a developer interview task.

This project contains the following modules:
* `task-data` - a general programming task with fixed requirements
* `task-calculator` - a general programming task with changing requirements 
* `task-optimise` - a code optimisation task
* `task-css` - a set of simple CSS tasks

Each module is independent and should be run separately.

To get started, please open `README.md` in a module and follow the instructions.
