## General programming task

Look at `CalculatorProvider.getCalculator()` and start from there. Your task is to provide an implementation of `Calculator` that makes the tests pass and is according to the requirements.

This task consists of up to 3 additional stages, depending on your skills and time left.

You have approximately 60 minutes to complete all the stages, although this is not a hard limit. Once all the tests pass, congratulations!
