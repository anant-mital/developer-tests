# Overview

This repository contains a few tasks to implement during a developer interview task.

This branch contains code optimisation task.

# TL;DR

1. Clone this repository and switch to `task-optimise`.
1. Run the tests (`mvn test` or run `OptimisationTest`).
1. Implement missing code so that all the tests pass.
1. ???
1. PROFIT.

# More details

You **are allowed** to search the web for any API or code examples related to your tasks. You are **not allowed** to search for solutions ;) 

Whenever you are unclear about what exactly is expected, **ask immediately**.

## Optimisation task

Look at `PascalNumberCalculator` and start from there. Your task here is to optimise the code to perform less computations. The program counts the numbers in the Pascal's Triangle (check [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) for reference).

You must use `LongSummator` for adding numbers, as that counts the number of operations. Other than that you are free to optimise the code in whatever way you seem appropriate.  

You have approximately 30 minutes, although this is not a hard limit. Once all the tests pass, congratulations!
